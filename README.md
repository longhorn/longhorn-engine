A microservice that does micro things.

## Building

`make`


## Using Longhorn in Rancher

You can use Longhorn to provide storage volumes to containers in Rancher. 

### Installation

1. Make sure you are running Rancher v1.4 or higher.
2. In ADMIN -> Settings, click "Add Catalog":
  - Name: `longhorn`
  - URL:  `https://github.com/rancher/rancher-catalog.git`
  - Branch: `longhorn`
  - (NOTE: Do not edit `library` catalog)
3. In STACKS â†’ Infrastructure, click "Add from Catalog" 
4. Choose "Longhorn" in the catalog, click "View Details" 
5. Click "Launch"

Once Longhorn storage driver is deployed, you can create Longhorn volumes and use them with your containers and services.


### Add a Longhorn Volume

Go to INFRASTRUCTURE -> Storage: you'll see `rancher-longhorn` driver. 

Click "Add Volume" and fill in the "Name" field.

**NOTE:** Volume names can use latin letters, numbers, `-` and `_`. Do not start or end the name with `-` or `_`.


You can also specify volume size (by default it is 10GB) with Driver Options (e.g. Key: `size`  Value: `300G`)

NOTE: volume size is automatically rounded up by 4096 bytes.


### Use a Longhorn Volume

It's important to note, that a Longhorn volume can only be attached to a single host at a time. The volume can be used by multiple containers on the host, though.

When creating a container or a service, you can specify the volume and the driver to mount into the container. 

For example, if we have created a Longhorn volume named `vol1`, we can use it to create a container:

Volumes: `vol1:/any/mount/path`
Volume Driver: `rancher-longhorn`


### Rancher UI Note: Longhorn Volume components

Longhorn driver creates and manages `controller` and `replica-<XXXX>` containers enabling the volumes. These will be shown in Rancher UI as part of the volume stacks in a future release. They are currently visible as standalone containers on your hosts. 

When a volume is mounted, a `controller` container is run on the same host as the client container and `replica-XXXX` containers are started.

When the volume is not used, `replica-XXXX` containers are stopped and the `controller` container is removed.


## Running Standalone

You can choose either TGT or TCMU frontend. TGT frontend is recommended. TGT
can work with majority of the Linux distributions, while TCMU can work with
RancherOS v0.4.4 and above only.

Host need to have `docker` installed. Run following command to check:
```
docker info
```

### With TGT frontend

User need to make sure the host has `iscsiadm` installed. Run following command to check:
```
iscsiadm --version
```

To start Longhorn with an single replica, run following command:
```
docker run --privileged -v /dev:/host/dev -v /proc:/host/proc -v /volume rancher/longhorn launch-simple-longhorn vol-name 10g tgt
```

That will create the device `/dev/longhorn/vol-name`

### With TCMU frontend

You need to be running RancherOS v0.4.4 (all kernel patches are upstreamed but only available after Linux v4.5).
Also ensure that TCMU is enabled:

    modprobe target_core_user
    mount -t configfs none /sys/kernel/config

To start Longhorn with an single replica, run following command:
```
docker run --privileged -v /dev:/host/dev -v /proc:/host/proc -v /sys/kernel/config:/sys/kernel/config -v /volume rancher/longhorn launch-simple-longhorn vol-name 10g tcmu
```

That will create the device `/dev/longhorn/vol-name`

### Longhorn with multiple replicas

In order to start Longhorn with multiple replicas, you need to setup a network between Longhorn replica container and controller container. Here we use Docker(v1.10 or later) network feature to demostrate that:

##### 1. Create a network named `longhorn-net`
```
docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 longhorn-net
```
##### 2. Add two replicas to the network, suppose their IPs are `172.18.0.2` and `172.18.0.3`:
```
docker run --net longhorn-net --ip 172.18.0.2 --expose 9502-9504 -v /volume rancher/longhorn launch replica --listen 172.18.0.2:9502 --size 10g /volume
docker run --net longhorn-net --ip 172.18.0.3 --expose 9502-9504 -v /volume rancher/longhorn launch replica --listen 172.18.0.3:9502 --size 10g /volume
```
Notice you need to expose port 9502 to 9504 for Longhorn controller to communicate with replica.
##### 3. Start Longhorn controller. Take TGT for example:
```
docker run --net longhorn-net --privileged -v /dev:/host/dev -v /proc:/host/proc rancher/longhorn launch controller --frontend tgt --replica tcp://172.18.0.2:9502 --replica tcp://172.18.0.3:9502 vol-name
```
Now you will have device `/dev/longhorn/vol-name`.
